# Description
- This is a test Web API using .NET and ASP.NET Minimal API and Enity Framwork Core.
- This project is for learning purposes and to teach me more about using Minimal APIs with EF Core.

## What's next
Right now I am testing the routes with an InMemory DB with EF Core. Once I have learned enough about configuring the Minimal API I will test it with SQL Server.

### NOTE To Self
- Using the minimal api setup seems to be the same as using the MVC model of an ASP.NET core application but instead of created the connnections in the controller
I am creating the connections in the Program.cs file. 

- See if the repository pattern can still be applied to the minimal api...
- See if creating DTOs is still posible...
- See if filtering is the same...
